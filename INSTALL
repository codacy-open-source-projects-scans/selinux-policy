fedora-selinux policy has the following build requirements:
	* libsepol 3.6
	* libsemanage 3.6
	* checkpolicy 3.6
	* policycoreutils 3.6
	* Python PyXML
	* Python >= 3.4

container-selinux source files need to be placed in policy/modules/contrib

    git clone --depth=1 -q https://github.com/containers/container-selinux container-selinux
    cp container-selinux/container.{if,te,fc} policy/modules/contrib

To install fedora-selinux policy sources into /etc/selinux/fedora-selinux/src/policy:

	make install-src

This will back up a pre-existing source policy to the
/etc/selinux/fedora-selinux/src/policy.bak directory.

You can use .conf files from dist/ directory:

    cp dist/targeted/*.conf policy/

or they can be generated:

	make conf

This will create a default modules.conf.  Options for the policy
build process can be found in build.conf.  After installing the policy sources,
the old Make targets have been maintained for the monolithic policy:

Local policy development:

	make policy

Compile and install the policy:

	make install

Compile, install, and load the policy:

	make load

Filesystem labeling:

	make relabel
	make checklabels
	make restorelabels

See the [README.build.md](README.build.md) for more information on available make targets.
